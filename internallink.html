<p>1. “The Tortoise and the Hare” by Aesop
The Tortoise and the HareThis classic fable (story) is about a very slow tortoise (turtle) and a speedy hare (rabbit). The tortoise challenges the hare to a race. The hare laughs at the idea that a tortoise could run faster than him, but the race ends with a surprising result.

Have you ever heard the English expression, “Slow and steady wins the race”? This story is the basis for that common phrase. You can read it for free, along with a number of other stories in this list!

2. “The Ant and the Grasshopper” by Aesop
very short english storiesThis is another great story that teaches a lesson that’s written for kids but adults can enjoy, too. The story tells of a grasshopper who lounges around all summer while his friend the ant prepares for the winter. When winter comes, the two friends end up in very different situations!

The moral is that those who save up during the good times will get to enjoy the benefits when times are bad.</p>
